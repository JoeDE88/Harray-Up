<p align="left">More and more people are trying to learn to program, and we know that it is not an easy task and in most cases it is not fun either. Many concepts are especially complicated to understand for new users due to the high level of abstraction they present. 

This is where Harray Up! comes in, an educational and fun web app designed to help users master JavaScript array methods through interactive games and challenges by treating arrays as sets of fruits. Harray Up! presents different levels with explanations and examples that challenge the user to solve each level.</p>
